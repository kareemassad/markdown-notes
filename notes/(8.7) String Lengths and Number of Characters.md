# (8.7) String Lengths and Number of Characters
To get the length of a string, use this:
```js
var name = "Kareem";
name.length;
```
This outputs: 6.

### Challenge 2: Write a program that outputs the number of characters you have written and how many you have left. (Like twitter)

```js
var tweet = prompt("Compose your tweet:");

var tweetCount = tweet.length;

alert("You have written " + tweetCount + " characters, you have " 
+ (140 - tweetCount) + "characters remaining.");

//This outputs "you have written X characters, you have Y characters left.
```
