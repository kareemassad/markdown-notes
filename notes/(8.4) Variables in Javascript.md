# (8.4) Variables in Javascript 

Prompt is like alert but asks for an input. The input can be stored in a variable
```js
prompt("What is your name?");
```

### To assign a variable:

Var only needs to occur once when you are initializing.

```js
var myName = "Kareem";
```

### Create an alert that shows my name
```js
alert(myName);
```

### Ask for the user's name, stores it, and uses the data using an alert

```js
var myName = "Kareem";
var yourName = prompt("What is your name?");

alert("My name is " + myName + ". welcome to my website " + "!"); 
```
