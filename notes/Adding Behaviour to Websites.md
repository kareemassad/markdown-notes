# Adding Behaviour to Websites

###### DATE: 11/8/2019

### Running code in the browser

- Can run javascript in the google chrome console.

- Can also run it in the sources > snippets > create file.

Use the console for 1 line and use snippet to execute all code.

#### EXAMPLE: 
This will create an alert in the browser

```js
alert("Hello!");
alert("World!");
```
This does the same thing as
```js
window.alert("Hello World!")
```
