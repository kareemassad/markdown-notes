# (8.20) Building a BMI calculator
Take the height and the weight as inputs and output the BMI.

The formula is:

$$BMI = weight(kg) / height^2(m^2)$$

Given:

```js
/* If my weight is 65kg and my heigh is 1.8m, I should be able to call the function 
   like such: 

var bmi = bmiCalculator(65,1.8);

bmi should equal around 20 in this case.

*/
```
Solution:
```js

function bmiCalculator(weight,height){
  var bmi = weight / (height * height);
  return bmi 
}

var yourWeight = prompt("How much do you weigh");
var yourHeight = prompt("How much do you height");

var yourBMI = bmiCalculator(yourWeight, yourHeight);

alert("Your bmi is: " + yourBMI + ".");
```
