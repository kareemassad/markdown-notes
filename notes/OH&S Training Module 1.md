### New Employees - The FORM 

The **New Employee Orientation Form** should be completed in the first month upon hiring by the manager. 

### Right to Refuse Dangerous Work

If you have resonable cause to believe: 
  * Use or operation of machine or thing constitutes a danger.
  * Conditions exist that constitute a danger.
  * Performance of any activity by an employee constitutes danger to you or to another employee.

  **You may exercise your right to refuse that existing or potentially hazardous work.**
